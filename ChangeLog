            - We should keep track of the environment used to *start* the Tomcat server so that *stop* and *status* commands
              could be run and automatically reuse the last environment if none provided with `--env`. We should also include a
              port option to allow each environment to have a dedicated port (or possibly set of ports).
            - Perhaps we should also keep track somewhere of all jarball dependencies, and merge their management with that of
              *PATinfo/sam-tomcat*

  - date  : 2021-08-17
    notes : Added `envs`, `changelog`, and `readme` commands.

            - Ð†ncorporate fn *view_changelog* into AIT as a universal `git-clog` utility
            - Likewise for fn *view_readme*, as perhaps a Git-aware `git-readme` utility
            - Fn *clog* and AIT fn *inform* should be merged
              - The former's `step-*` targets should be implemented in the latter
              - The former uses `croak-`, the latter `--force`... choose or combine
              - We should have a *lite* version of fn *inform* that has no AIT dependencies

  - date  : 2021-08-16
    notes : Adapted code to support TomEE and other Java JDK/JRE versions

  - date  : 2021-08-15
    notes : Initial version (based on Tomcat 6 and Java 6)
