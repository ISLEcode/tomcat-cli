            - We should keep track of the environment used to *start* the Tomcat server so that *stop* and *status* commands
              could be run and automatically reuse the last environment if none provided with `--env`. We should also include a
              port option to allow each environment to have a dedicated port (or possibly set of ports).
            - Perhaps we should also keep track somewhere of all jarball dependencies, and merge their management with that of
              *PATinfo/sam-tomcat*

  - date  : 2021-08-23
    nodes : Added auto-dectection of .env file in SAMinfo repository when invoked without an --env option

  - date  : 2021-08-22
    nodes : Added autoconfiguration capability that allows to recreate a PID file from a Tomcat process. This feature is enabled
            when the `--force` option is enabled; if the option is not set, and the verbosity level is appropriately set (`-vvv`)
            the run command will be output the options required to reuse the same environment via the `tomcat` utility.

  - date  : 2021-08-19
    notes : Added the `commands` command as well as support for *external* commands à-la Git.
    todo  : In `rc.prog.fpath` we need to distinguish commands from utility functions otherwise all `tomcat_*` functions will be
            assumed to be commands. This could be achieve, for instance, by adding a Doxygen-like tag `@command` whose presence
            indicates that this is a command. This could also be used for external commands as a means of passing configuration
            options (e.g. what options to enable or disable).

  - date  : 2021-08-17
    notes : Added `envs`, `changelog`, and `readme` commands.
    todo  : |
            - Іncorporate fn *view_changelog* into AIT as a universal `git-clog` utility
            - Likewise for fn *view_readme*, as perhaps a Git-aware `git-readme` utility
            - Fn *clog* and AIT fn *inform* should be merged
              - The former's `step-*` targets should be implemented in the latter
              - The former uses `croak-`, the latter `--force`... choose or combine
              - We should have a *lite* version of fn *inform* that has no AIT dependencies

  - date  : 2021-08-16
    notes : Transformed Tomcat support into TomEE support to have a full-fledged Java EE environment.

  - date  : 2021-08-15
    notes : Initial version of this script to mordernise `gp-tomcat`, make it Open Source, and deprecate dependencies on the AIT
            framework. Additional `gp-*` commands will progressively make their way into this script such as the automated build
            and installation of Tomcat.

            - Fn *tomcat_cleanup*: cleanup directories ~/work ~/conf/Catalina ... ~/tmp/*
            - Fn *tomcat_install*: this needs to be implemented
            - Fn *tomcat_check*: this needs to be further tested and consolidated
            - Fn *tomcat_mkjavacmd*:
              1. Blindly copied code; need to understand its purpose
            - Fn *tomcat_mksnapshot*: this needs to be implemented
            - Fn *tomcat_mkusage*: --??api, --??html, --??nroff don't work, why?
            - Fn *tomcat_start*:
              1. Add support for `--pipe` option when scanning the log file for server startup message
            - Fn *tomcat_update*: This needs to be implemented

  - date  : 2012-06-21
    notes : Initial version of the `gp-tomcat` utility still used today in production for SAMinfo.
